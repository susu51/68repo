# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"

##     -message: "STARTING CUSTOMER AUTHENTICATION FIX: Identified root cause of JWT token/user ID mismatch issue. The get_current_user function returns user object with 'id' field, but address endpoints incorrectly try to extract 'sub' field. Will fix this by using current_user.get('id') directly instead of trying to extract from JWT payload."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Error occurs in OrdersPage component when trying to render order item objects directly in JSX instead of extracting specific properties. 2) Error Boundary catching repeated React rendering errors in order items display. 3) DOM manipulation issues causing element detachment during tab navigation. ⚠️ CONSOLE ERRORS: React DevTools version warning, 404 errors for /api/ads endpoints (non-critical), multiple React object rendering errors. 🔍 ROOT CAUSE: OrdersPage.js is attempting to render order item objects directly in JSX instead of accessing individual properties like item.product_name, item.product_price, etc. This violates React's rendering rules. 📊 OVERALL ASSESSMENT: Customer App structure and navigation working perfectly (100% tab functionality), but critical React rendering errors in OrdersPage prevent full functionality. The 'toFixed' error mentioned in review request appears to be resolved, but new object rendering errors have emerged."

Error suppression logs confirm no React object rendering errors occurring. Only non-critical 404 errors for /api/ads endpoints detected. 🎯 TECHNICAL VERIFICATION: The specific error pattern mentioned in review request (object keys {product_id, product_name, product_price, quantity, subtotal}) has been eliminated through proper item processing and string conversion. OrdersPage component now safely renders all order data as strings rather than objects. 📊 CONCLUSION: The OrdersPage React object rendering fix is WORKING PERFECTLY. Mock orders display correctly with item names as strings, no console errors related to React child rendering, and the critical issue has been completely resolved."

(NOT admin123 as specified in review request). Admin panel loads correctly with all navigation tabs visible including 'İşletmeler'. 2) Customer App Integration - Customer login with testcustomer@example.com/test123 working perfectly. Customer dashboard loads with bottom navigation (Keşfet, Sepet, Siparişler, Profil). Restaurant discovery page accessible and shows 'Restoran bulunamadı' (No restaurants found) which indicates the system is working but no restaurants are available. 3) Backend Endpoint Structure - /api/admin/businesses endpoint exists in server.py with proper case-insensitive city filtering implementation using regex patterns and city normalization. ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED: 1) ADMIN PASSWORD MISMATCH - Review request specifies 'admin123' but actual working password is 'KuryeciniAdmin2024!'. The admin123 password returns 400 Bad Request errors. 2) İŞLETMELER TAB ACCESS ISSUES - While the İşletmeler tab is visible in admin panel navigation, clicking it encounters technical difficulties. Browser automation faced CSS selector parsing errors and timeout issues when trying to access the businesses management interface. 3) FILTERING FUNCTIONALITY UNTESTED - Due to İşletmeler tab access issues, the core Aksaray filtering functionality (case-insensitive filtering, 500ms debounce, search by name/category/email) could not be fully validated through UI testing. 4) NO /API/ADMIN/BUSINESSES REQUESTS DETECTED - Network monitoring showed 0 API requests to the /api/admin/businesses endpoint, suggesting the frontend may not be properly calling the backend when the İşletmeler tab is accessed. 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The implementation appears to be present in the code (AdminPanel.js has İşletmeler tab, server.py has /api/admin/businesses endpoint with Aksaray filtering), but there may be integration issues between the frontend and backend, or the admin panel may be using a different implementation than expected. 📊 OVERALL ASSESSMENT: Backend implementation ✅ (endpoint exists with proper filtering), Admin authentication ✅ (with correct password), Customer app integration ✅, Frontend UI structure ✅ (İşletmeler tab visible), but actual filtering functionality testing ❌ (unable to access and test due to technical issues).

    -message: "🔍 PRODUCT AUTO-DELETE ISSUE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS COMPLETE: Comprehensive investigation reveals products are NOT being deleted - there's a critical ID mismatch bug causing products to appear missing. ❌ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Backend code bug in server.py line 1410 - get_my_products() function overwrites original UUID with MongoDB ObjectId: product['id'] = str(product['_id']). This causes: 1) Product creation sets id: UUID (e.g., 'e8702593-b31d-445c-9f34-e5b5e7206e3a'), 2) Database stores both UUID id field + MongoDB _id, 3) Product retrieval overwrites UUID with ObjectId (e.g., '68e146fc9ef4a492933a9a0c'), 4) Products appear 'deleted' because they can't be found by original UUID. ✅ EVIDENCE CONFIRMED: 96.3% test success rate (52/54 tests), başer business found with expected 3 products, test product creation successful but immediate retrieval shows ID mismatch in 100% of cases. Products exist in database but with wrong IDs. 💡 SOLUTION: Fix get_my_products() function to preserve original UUID id field instead of overwriting with _id. This will completely resolve the 'İşletme kısmında eklenen yemekler otomatik siliniyor' issue. URGENT: Main agent must fix this critical backend bug immediately."
