## Rollback Scenarios & Procedures

### Scenario 1: Complete Deployment Failure
**Symptoms**: Site completely down, health checks failing
**Action**: Immediate rollback
**Timeline**: 5 minutes

```bash
1. Rollback backend to last known good commit
2. Rollback frontend to last known good deployment  
3. Verify health endpoints
4. Monitor error rates for 15 minutes
5. If stable, investigate root cause
```

### Scenario 2: Critical Bug in Production
**Symptoms**: App functional but critical bug affecting users
**Action**: Conditional rollback or hotfix
**Timeline**: 30 minutes decision window

```bash
1. Assess bug severity and user impact
2. If high impact: immediate rollback
3. If medium impact: prepare hotfix in parallel
4. Deploy hotfix OR rollback within 30 minutes
```

### Scenario 3: Performance Degradation
**Symptoms**: Slow response times, high error rates
**Action**: Investigate then rollback if needed
**Timeline**: 15 minutes investigation

```bash
1. Check monitoring dashboards
2. Review deployment logs
3. If performance doesn't recover in 15 min: rollback
4. Investigate root cause post-rollback
```

### Scenario 4: Database Migration Issues
**Symptoms**: Data consistency problems, migration failures
**Action**: Backend rollback + DB restore
**Timeline**: 60 minutes

```bash
1. Stop all write operations
2. Rollback backend to pre-migration version
3. Restore database from backup (if needed)
4. Verify data integrity
5. Resume operations
```
