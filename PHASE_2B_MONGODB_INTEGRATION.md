# 🔧 PHASE 2B: REAL MONGODB INTEGRATION
**Start Time:** 2025-10-07 16:00 UTC
**Objective:** Implement missing backend API endpoints for real MongoDB queries
**Dependencies:** Phase 2A completion (Mock data eliminated)

## 🎯 MISSING ENDPOINTS TO IMPLEMENT

### Business Dashboard Endpoints
1. `/api/business/orders/incoming` - Get pending orders for business
2. `/api/business/orders/active` - Get active orders in preparation
3. `/api/business/stats` - Real business statistics from orders
4. `/api/business/financials` - Real financial data calculation

### Payment & Transaction Endpoints  
5. `/api/payments/process` - Real payment processing endpoint

## 🧪 TESTING RESULTS

### Backend API Testing: **100% SUCCESS** ✅
```bash
✅ Business Authentication - testbusiness@example.com working (Business ID: business-001)
✅ Customer Authentication - testcustomer@example.com working (Customer ID: customer-001)  
✅ GET /api/business/orders/incoming - Real MongoDB queries (empty arrays = correct)
✅ GET /api/business/orders/active - Real MongoDB queries (empty arrays = correct)
✅ GET /api/business/stats - Real statistics calculation working
✅ GET /api/business/financials - Real financial data from delivered orders  
✅ POST /api/payments/process - Payment processing creates MongoDB records
✅ Authentication Security - All endpoints properly protected (403 without auth)
✅ Real MongoDB Integration - Data consistency verified, no mock data detected
```

### Test Orders Created: **2** orders for testing ✅
### Payment Records Created: **2** transactions (TXN_E4627678, TXN_4D182263) ✅
### Security Verified: **RBAC** working correctly ✅
