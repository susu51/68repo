The trajectory details an iterative development process for the Kuryecini delivery application, guided by frequent and specific user feedback. The AI engineer's work began by addressing user-reported issues concerning a missing map in the Courier Panel and a disorganized Customer Dashboard. Initial fixes involved correcting the tab structure and data handling in  and adding missing backend API endpoints in . The Customer Dashboard in  was reorganized for better UX.

Subsequent user requests led to significant UI/UX refactoring. The Courier Panel was transformed from a top-tab to a side-tab layout, and the map was integrated directly into the orders view for a streamlined workflow. The Business Panel () was completely rewritten into a professional, multi-tab dashboard with comprehensive analytics and management tools. The customer-facing UI was also changed to a side-tab layout.

The final phase involved extensive debugging of runtime errors, including fixing an undefined  function, resolving a critical authentication loop by correcting backend endpoint duplication and frontend state management, and adding safety checks to prevent crashes. The engineer is currently implementing a major overhaul of the customer's ordering flow, focusing on cart persistence, address management, and a redesigned restaurant menu interface, as per the user's latest detailed request.

<product_requirements>
Kuryecini is a full-stack food and package delivery application for the Turkish market, designed to serve four distinct roles: Customer, Courier, Business, and Admin.

The platform's core functionality includes user authentication (JWT-based, with email/password and OAuth options), real-time order tracking via Leaflet maps, and role-specific dashboards for managing operations.

**Implemented Features:**
- **Admin Panel**: User management, marketing tools, and KYC review capabilities.
- **Courier Panel**: A multi-tab dashboard with side navigation, featuring an integrated map in the orders tab, real-time order management, earnings tracking, and profile settings.
- **Business Panel**: A professional dashboard for restaurant owners to manage orders, menus (including adding products and changing prices), view detailed statistics, and control restaurant status (open/closed).
- **Customer Frontend**: A user-friendly interface for browsing restaurants, viewing menus, and managing a profile.

**Current Development Focus:**
The immediate goal is to overhaul the customer's end-to-end ordering experience. This involves implementing robust cart functionality with state persistence, building an address management system for users to save and select delivery locations, and redesigning the restaurant menu UI to be more intuitive with categories, filtering, and a modern aesthetic.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frameworks**: React.js (frontend), FastAPI (backend).
- **Database**: MongoDB.
- **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components, Leaflet/OpenStreetMap for maps.
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **State Management**: React hooks (, ), localStorage for cart persistence.
- **API Communication**: Axios for frontend HTTP requests to the FastAPI backend.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monolithic repository structure with separate directories for the frontend and backend services.


-   **/app/backend/server.py**
    -   **Importance**: The core of the backend application. It defines all API endpoints using FastAPI, handles business logic, user authentication (JWT creation and validation), and interacts with the MongoDB database.
    -   **Changes**: Numerous changes were made, including adding missing API endpoints for courier (, ) and business () panels. A critical fix involved removing a duplicate  endpoint that was causing authentication failures. The  function was modified to correctly validate in-memory test users.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**
    -   **Importance**: The main entry point for the React frontend. It manages routing, global state (like authentication and the shopping cart), and contains the implementation for the Customer Dashboard.
    -   **Changes**: The customer dashboard UI was significantly refactored from a cluttered multi-button layout to a clean side-tab navigation system. The authentication logic was fixed to correctly map user data from the backend response.  was added to persist the shopping cart to .
-   **/app/frontend/src/CourierDashboard.js**
    -   **Importance**: Provides the user interface for couriers.
    -   **Changes**: This file underwent multiple major rewrites based on user feedback. It was changed from a top-tab to a side-tab layout. The separate Map tab was removed, and the Leaflet map was integrated directly into the Orders tab to create a unified workflow for managing deliveries.
-   **/app/frontend/src/BusinessDashboard_Enhanced.js**
    -   **Importance**: The primary interface for business owners.
    -   **Changes**: This file was completely rewritten from a basic panel to a professional, feature-rich dashboard with side-tab navigation, detailed analytics (daily performance, popular products), and comprehensive controls for managing orders, menus, and restaurant status. It was debugged to fix runtime errors caused by missing function definitions (, ).
-   **/app/frontend/src/FoodOrderSystem.js**
    -   **Importance**: Manages the customer-facing restaurant browsing and menu interaction experience.
    -   **Changes**: A critical runtime error, , was fixed by correctly defining the function within the  component. The file is currently being refactored to implement a new menu design with categories and filtering, and an enhanced checkout modal that incorporates address selection.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/AddressSelector.js**
    -   **Importance**: A new component created to handle address management.
    -   **Changes**: Created to allow users to select, add, or edit saved addresses during the checkout process, as part of the current work on improving the customer order flow.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement a comprehensive payment gateway integration (e.g., Iyzico).
- Develop a commission reporting system for the platform.
- Build out remaining Admin Panel features, such as user suspension and business menu approval.
- Create a financial reporting and a customer complaint system.
- Finalize the Business KYC (Know Your Customer) frontend approval flow.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is actively implementing a comprehensive overhaul of the customer's order flow, based on a detailed request from the user. This work spans three main areas:

1.  **Cart Functionality**: The immediate goal is to make the shopping cart fully functional and persistent.
    -   In , the cart button UI has been updated to display the total price using a  function.
    -   A  hook was added to  to save the cart's state to  on any change and to load it on initial render, ensuring the cart contents are not lost between page reloads or navigation.
    -   The  function was confirmed to exist, but the Add to Cart button's functionality is still being fully integrated with the new menu UI.

2.  **Customer Address Management**: A system for users to manage their delivery addresses is being built.
    -   A new component has been created at . This component will house the UI for selecting an existing address or adding a new one.
    -   This new address selector is being integrated into the checkout process within .

3.  **Restaurant Menu Redesign**: The restaurant menu interface is being modernized.
    -   In , the UI is being refactored to support menu categories (e.g., Starters, Main Dishes, Drinks). State variables like  and  have been added to manage filtering and sorting.
    -   The  function is being updated to trigger a new, more advanced modal that includes the  component, making the checkout process more robust and user-friendly. The engineer was in the process of adding this modal component to the file's render logic.
