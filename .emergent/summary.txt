The previous AI engineer diligently addressed multiple critical issues and implemented significant features in the Kuryecini application. Initial work focused on stabilizing frontend authentication, WebSockets, and resolving various UI/API bugs. Key achievements included a robust WebSocket for multi-tab support, integrating a business dashboard with real data, and refining order status transitions. The engineer tackled persistent issues like Pydantic model errors, authorization flaws, and an infinite refresh loop in the business panel, which was eventually traced to a  call in . Subsequently, efforts shifted to developing a comprehensive courier map, displaying nearby businesses with order counts, and enabling order claiming. This involved correcting backend queries to use the  collection for business data and integrating advanced map functionalities. The final challenge involves resolving a  error within the  component, indicating issues with UI component rendering, likely due to conflicts between React's reconciliation and direct DOM manipulation or improper component usage. The engineer is currently refactoring the  component to use native HTML, moving away from problematic UI libraries.

The Kuryecini platform is a multi-role application for real-time order management (Customer, Business, Courier, Admin). Initial features included real-time notifications, a stable customer Order and Confirm flow, unique order codes, and a simplified order status transition: Pending → Confirmed → Ready (originally more complex). A business dashboard with real-time data, printable order slips, and a comprehensive courier map showing nearby businesses with ready orders for claiming were also developed.

Recent requirements have focused on refining the courier experience. This includes a package pool system where all couriers can view available orders on a map, with businesses appearing as custom markers. Clicking a marker reveals a list of orders for that business. Couriers can accept an order, which then displays full details (customer info, delivery address, payment, order items). Buttons for Paketi Aldım (Picked Up) and Teslim Ettim (Delivered) are required to update order status. The system should avoid automatic courier assignment and ensure all updates are real-time via WebSockets. Business registration should allow package/cover photo uploads, generating 64x64 and 128x128 icons for map markers, with a fallback default icon. Markers must display an active order count badge.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a persistent  error in the  component, specifically when using UI components from . This error indicated a conflict between React's rendering process and how these components were being handled, possibly due to direct DOM manipulation or incorrect prop usage within a context. The  component is intended to serve as the central hub for couriers, displaying a map with business markers (with active order badges), and a list of available orders for selected businesses. The engineer had previously attempted several fixes, including creating simpler map components like  and  and ensuring correct  usage, but the  error persisted. The latest approach is to completely rewrite sections of the  component using native HTML instead of  components to eliminate potential conflicts and resolve the  error. This involves reviewing the current implementation of  to identify where the problematic UI components are used and replace them with basic HTML elements to ensure stable rendering.
