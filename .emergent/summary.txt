The AI engineer's work on Kuryecini involved initial bug fixes, a significant feature expansion, multiple UI rollbacks, and subsequent panel enhancements. Initially, critical issues like logout is not defined and duplicate backend API endpoints were debugged and resolved, stabilizing the core application. Following this, the user requested a partial UI rollback for the Courier and Admin panels to an older style, while retaining new functionalities, which required iterative adjustments and fetching source from a GitHub repository for the Courier panel. Once the UI consistency was addressed, the engineer proceeded to enhance both the Courier and Business panels, adding detailed features like multi-tab dashboards, order management workflows, earnings reports, and comprehensive product/restaurant management. The trajectory concludes with user feedback indicating issues with the courier panel's map functionality and general disorganization in the customer section, suggesting ongoing refinement is needed.

<product_requirements>
Kuryecini is a Turkish package/food delivery platform for Customer, Courier, Business, and Admin roles, featuring JWT auth and Leaflet/OpenStreetMap. The app is fully rebranded and supports all 81 Turkish provinces.

**Implemented (Previous Trajectory & Current Work):** Admin login (password 6851), mobile/dark/light themed admin panel with user management, marketing-themed customer dashboard with loyalty programs, fixed city/category selection, resolved no food visible and  errors, location-based sorting,  serialization,  handling. New features include customer profile (address, loyalty, orders), modern login (phone, email/password, Google/Apple OAuth), homepage ad carousel, enhanced menu categories, and initial structures for courier/business/admin dashboards.

**User-Driven Rollback & Feature Expansion:** User requested restoring older UI for Courier and Admin panels while preserving/integrating new features. Customer profile to be organized. Courier panel specifically needed a map. Later, explicit development of Courier and Business panels was requested sequentially.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had successfully completed significant enhancements to both the **Courier Panel** and the **Business Panel**.

The **Courier Panel** (), after several iterations including a full rollback to a GitHub version, was transformed into a comprehensive 5-tab dashboard. This included:
-   Order management with nearby orders, real-time updates, and an online/offline toggle.
-   A dedicated Earnings tab with income cards and commission details.
-   A Map tab for GPS-enabled interactive maps showing order locations and routes.
-   History and Profile tabs for past orders, personal info, and notification settings.
-   Several  components were replaced with basic checkboxes to resolve import issues, and a JSX syntax error was fixed.

The **Business Panel** (, implemented via  logic) was also fully developed with:
-   Robust order management (pending, active orders, accept/reject, status updates).
-   Detailed menu and product management (CRUD, stock, categories).
-   Comprehensive reports and statistics (daily, weekly, monthly, total revenue, customer satisfaction, net earnings).
-   Restaurant settings with an open/closed toggle.

Both panels were tested and confirmed to be working and feature-rich. However, the user's latest feedback (Chat 288) indicates that the **courier panel's map functionality is still not as expected** (Kurye paneline harita eklememissin) and the **customer section feels disorganized** (müşteri kısmıda çok dağınık). The AI engineer's immediate response (Chat 289-303) shows an attempt to debug the courier login issue (which prevents map testing) and a preliminary check of  for disorganization.
