The AI engineer's work primarily focused on resolving critical authentication issues, implementing a major City-Strict hotfix, and enhancing the application's UI/UX. A significant recurring challenge was the  in  repeatedly reverting, necessitating hardcoding in critical frontend files. Simultaneously, the agent successfully implemented backend features for city-strict catalog filtering and address management, including MongoDB schema updates and test data seeding. In the UI/UX domain, the agent removed old login forms, integrated the Kuryecini logo across various application pages, and has just begun developing a comprehensive, modern landing page with detailed section requirements. The trajectory concludes with the initial setup for the new landing page in .

<product_requirements>
Kuryecini is a Turkish food/package delivery platform for Customer, Courier, Business, and Admin roles, aiming for production deployment. The architecture requires a React/Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL (target database), HttpOnly cookie-based JWT authentication, RBAC, Sentry, Docker, and Playwright E2E tests. Critical rules prohibit / and  usage, enforce  JWT with refresh tokens,  for passwords, and RBAC.

Key features implemented or in progress:
*   **Authentication Overhaul:** Transitioned from  to HttpOnly cookie-based JWT.
*   **City-Strict Catalog Rules:** Implemented location-based business discovery with strict city/district filtering () using MongoDB's  and 2dsphere indexes.
*   **Address Management:** Enhanced CRUD operations for customer addresses.
*   **UI/UX Improvements:** Removed old login forms, integrated the Kuryecini logo consistently across the application, and initiated development of a modern landing page.

-   ****: New file for HttpOnly cookie JWT auth. Updated for  and temporary Bearer token support.
-   ** (NEW)**: Handles address CRUD, slug generation, GeoJSON points.
-   ** (NEW)**: Implements  for city-strict, geo-located business discovery.
-   ****: Main React component. Updated for new ,  integration, removal of old login forms, and currently being structured for the new landing page. Hardcoded backend URL due to persistent  issues.
-   ****: New/Modified HTTP client with . Fixed 401 redirect loop, supports temporary Bearer tokens. Hardcoded backend URL.
-   ****: Modified to remove  and direct token references for cookie auth. Hardcoded backend URL.
-   ****: Modified to use the provided Kuryecini logo image.
-   ****: Login modal. Modified to correctly use the  client, handle form submission, and integrates Kuryecini logo across its UI elements.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer received a detailed product requirement to design and implement a modern, professional landing page for Kuryecini. The user specified various sections including a Hero, Statistics, Advantages, User Testimonials, Trust (with payment/media logos), and a Footer, emphasizing a minimal yet modern design with gradients and rounded corners, mobile-first.

The AI engineer has begun implementing this task by making initial structural modifications to . This involves replacing the previous homepage content with the new landing page layout, including placeholders or initial content for the specified sections. The work is in its very early stages, focusing on setting up the overall page structure and design elements for the new landing page experience.
