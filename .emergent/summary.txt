The trajectory documents the development of the Kuryecini application, a full-stack delivery platform. The process began with fixing initial UI bugs in the Courier and Customer dashboards and adding missing backend endpoints. Following user feedback, the project evolved into a major UI/UX overhaul, including a complete rewrite of the Business and Courier panels into professional, feature-rich dashboards with integrated maps and analytics.

A significant portion of the work involved intensive debugging of critical frontend runtime errors. These included fixing duplicate variable declarations, handling  calls on undefined stats objects by implementing safety checks and proper state initialization, resolving React object-rendering errors by creating a safe rendering utility, and fixing a recurring  DOM error by implementing  cleanup functions and an Error Boundary.

The focus then shifted to enhancing the customer order flow by implementing a persistent cart, an address management system, and an improved checkout modal. The final phase involved a major architectural refactor requested by the user: migrating all persistent state from  to a MongoDB backend, managed via a new set of REST APIs and secured with  cookies and CSRF protection to mitigate XSS risks. The last user request was to package the web application as an Android app.

<product_requirements>
Kuryecini is a full-stack food and package delivery application for the Turkish market, designed to serve four distinct user roles: Customer, Courier, Business, and Admin.

**Core Functionality:**
The platform provides role-specific dashboards for managing operations. Customers can browse restaurants, manage a cart, and place orders. Couriers manage deliveries via an interactive map interface. Businesses manage their menu, orders, and view analytics. Admins oversee the entire platform, managing users and content.

**Architectural Requirements & Evolution:**
Initially, the application used standard JWT authentication with tokens stored in . However, due to security concerns, a major architectural shift was mandated. The current requirement is to eliminate all client-side storage (/) for sensitive or persistent data.
- **State Management**: All user data, including shopping carts, addresses, and preferences, must be stored and managed on the server (MongoDB).
- **Authentication**: JWTs must be delivered via ,  cookies with  and CSRF protection to prevent token theft via XSS attacks.
- **Frontend**: The React frontend should be stateless regarding persistent data, fetching (hydrating) all necessary information from the backend upon loading.
- **Mobile**: The web application should be packaged as a native Android application.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frameworks**: React.js (Create React App), FastAPI (Python).
- **Database**: MongoDB.
- **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components, Leaflet/OpenStreetMap for maps.
- **Authentication**: Evolved from localStorage JWTs to a more secure  cookie-based session management with CSRF protection.
- **State Management**: Migrated from client-side  for cart persistence to a server-side, database-driven state model.
- **API Communication**: Axios for frontend HTTP requests.
- **Mobile Deployment**: Progressive Web App (PWA) with Trusted Web Activity (TWA) for Android packaging.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with distinct frontend and backend directories.



-   **backend/server.py (and later backend/app/main.py)**
    -   **Importance**: The core FastAPI application defining all API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: Initially held all logic. Later refactored for production deployment on services like Render. Endpoints were added for , a standardized , and crucially, new endpoints in  were created to manage server-side state for carts, addresses, and user preferences, replacing previous  reliance. Authentication logic was moved to  to handle secure  cookies and CSRF tokens.

-   **frontend/src/App.js**
    -   **Importance**: The main React component, managing routing and global state.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to remove -based cart persistence. It now orchestrates API calls to fetch user data (cart, addresses) on load and passes this state down to child components like . The  is wrapped in the  here.

-   **frontend/src/FoodOrderSystem.js**
    -   **Importance**: The primary customer-facing component for browsing menus and ordering.
    -   **Changes**: This file underwent extensive debugging to fix multiple runtime errors. It was heavily refactored to remove its own local cart state and instead receive and manipulate the global cart state via props passed from . The enhanced checkout modal, which uses the  component, was integrated here. All direct  access was removed as part of the architectural overhaul.

-   **frontend/src/BusinessDashboard_Enhanced.js**
    -   **Importance**: The main interface for business owners.
    -   **Changes**: A critical runtime error () was fixed by adding safety checks (e.g., ) and ensuring the initial  state object was properly defined with all necessary properties.

-   **frontend/src/utils/databaseState.js**
    -   **Importance**: A new utility created to centralize all API interactions for fetching and updating user state that was previously in .
    -   **Changes**: This file was created to abstract the logic for hydrating the application state from the new backend endpoints (e.g., fetching cart, addresses).
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the migration from  to a fully server-side state management system with  cookies.
- Implement the Progressive Web App (PWA) features (Service Worker, Manifest) and package the application into a native Android APK using Trusted Web Activity (TWA).
- Integrate a real payment gateway (e.g., Iyzico).
- Fully build out the remaining Admin Panel features, such as commission reporting and a customer complaint system.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The engineer was in the middle of a critical architectural overhaul mandated by the user to enhance security and centralize state management. The primary goal is to completely eliminate the use of  and  in the frontend.

**Backend Work:**
- A new file, , was created to refactor the authentication system to use  cookies for JWTs and implement CSRF protection.
- The MongoDB schemas in  were being updated to include collections for , , and  to store data previously held on the client.
- A new API module, , was created to define the CRUD endpoints (, , etc.) needed for the frontend to manage this server-side state.

**Frontend Work:**
- A utility file, , was created to act as a service layer, centralizing all API calls that will replace direct  access. This service will be used to hydrate the React state with data from the database on initial page load.

This work was interrupted by the user's most recent request to package the web application for Android. The engineer had just proposed using a PWA + TWA strategy to achieve this.

<optional_next_step>
Begin implementing the Progressive Web App (PWA) manifest and service worker to make the web application installable and offline-capable, as the first step toward creating the Android app via Trusted Web Activity (TWA).
