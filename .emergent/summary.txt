The AI engineer continued developing the Kuryecini application, focusing on real-time order management. The initial analysis provided by the system prompt detailed previous work including bug fixes for order display, frontend  issues, business dashboard counts, DiscoverPage GPS, mobile keyboard, and Admin Settings rendering. A major part was the implementation of a comprehensive real-time order routing system with new database models, WebSocket integration, and frontend notifications.

The current trajectory details the work on integrating real-time order visibility into the Admin Panel. This involved modifying backend WebSocket logic for admin roles, creating a new frontend hook (), and integrating this into  and  to display live orders with filters. Debugging efforts primarily focused on resolving WebSocket connection issues, first identifying a missing  prefix in the frontend URL construction, and then, after fixing that, addressing a persistent WebSocket is closed before connection is established error. A troubleshoot agent was consulted, diagnosing a failing event bus subscription. Error handling was added, but the issue persists, indicating further investigation is needed.

<product_requirements>
The Kuryecini platform is a multi-role (Customer, Business, Courier, Admin) application built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. Core features include robust address management, geocoding for restaurant discovery, role-specific registration with KYC, and advertisement display. Recent development introduced a modern, theme-aware login/registration UX and comprehensive menu management. Customer discovery utilizes city/district and GPS filtering. An Admin Settings panel was implemented, including a maintenance mode feature. The primary objective is a flawless end-to-end order flow across all user panels (customer, business, courier). The latest, significant requirement was to harden the order routing system with strict data models, indexing, API validations, real-time WebSocket updates, RBAC, improved notifications, and testing. The current work specifically extends this real-time order visibility to the Admin panel.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on integrating real-time order visibility into the Admin Panel. This involved:
1.  **Backend Enhancements**: Modifying  to support  in WebSocket connections and ensuring the  publishes to an orders:all topic for admin.
2.  **Frontend Hook**: Creating  to manage the WebSocket connection and process notifications for the admin panel.
3.  **Admin Panel Integration**: Updating  and  to incorporate the new hook, display real-time order data, add filter functionality for order statuses (e.g., Bekleyen, Hazırlanıyor), and show WebSocket connection status.
4.  **Debugging WebSocket Connection**: The primary issue encountered was a persistent WebSocket is closed before the connection is established error. Initial attempts involved fixing a missing  prefix in the WebSocket URL constructed on the frontend (Chat Message 80-87). After correcting the URL, the error persisted, leading to a consultation with the .
5.  **Troubleshoot Agent Diagnosis & Fix Attempt**: The  identified that the Event bus subscription fails, causing the WebSocket to close immediately. Based on this, error handling was added to the WebSocket handler in  (Chat Message 103).
Despite these changes, the WebSocket connection issue remains unresolved, and the WebSocket is closed before the connection is established error persists, indicating the underlying problem with the event bus subscription or WebSocket handshake is still present.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate why the WebSocket connection is still failing after adding error handling, specifically examining backend logs for subscription errors.
