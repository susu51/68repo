The AI engineer's trajectory showcases a systematic approach to enhancing the Kuryecini application. Initially, the focus was on critical bug fixes and foundational feature additions, including a complete rebranding and 81-province support. The work then shifted to integrating admin login into the standard flow, redesigning the admin panel for mobile responsiveness and user management. This phase involved significant debugging of persistent JSX and runtime errors in , often requiring a rebuild of components. Subsequently, a comprehensive marketing-focused customer theme was introduced, including hero sections, social proof, popular products, campaigns, and loyalty systems, again requiring DOM error resolution. The most recent completed task addressed city selection issues in registration forms. The current work was interrupted by a new request regarding food visibility on the customer side, pausing the business registration KYC implementation.

Kuryecini (formerly DeliverTR) is a Turkish package/food delivery platform with a 3% commission, allowing anyone to be a courier. It supports Customer, Courier, Business, and Admin roles, featuring JWT authentication, Admin KYC approval for couriers, an Admin panel for management, and Leaflet/OpenStreetMap integration for real-time order tracking via WebSockets. Businesses manage menus, while couriers have city-wide nearby orders and live location.

Recent feature additions include a professional food order system for customers, location-based restaurant filtering, and a Show My Location button. The application is fully branded as Kuryecini, supporting 81 Turkish provinces in registration.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing two issues related to business registration: 1) the registration completion not redirecting to the business panel, and 2) the requirement for every registered business to undergo KYC approval via the admin panel before being published.

The AI engineer started by investigating the  component's submit function in  and the  endpoint in . The plan was to first add  and  endpoints to the backend to facilitate the KYC flow. The backend modifications for these endpoints were successfully implemented in  and .

However, this work was interrupted by a new, urgent request from the user: Hiçbir yemek müşteri kısmında gözükmüyor (No food visible on customer side). The AI engineer acknowledged this and shifted focus to investigate the 's product listing in  to resolve the food visibility issue for customers.
