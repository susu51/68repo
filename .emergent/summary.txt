The previous AI engineer initiated the Kuryecini application, implementing core features like UI, backend, MongoDB integration, and JWT authentication. Initial efforts involved resolving critical  validation issues and persistent  DOM errors by downgrading React, disabling StrictMode, and using aggressive suppression techniques. A  component issue was resolved by reverting to native HTML. The focus then shifted to building a comprehensive food ordering system (menu, cart, profile, order history), which began with a  in .

The trajectory shows extensive debugging of this , identifying misplaced render functions and incorrect JSX nesting, and later a  error. A significant hurdle was a persistent **service worker caching issue** that caused browser errors despite successful compilation, which was eventually bypassed by disabling the service worker. Subsequently, the system was re-architected to a Trendyol Go-like customer app with bottom navigation. New backend endpoints and Pydantic models were created. Frontend issues like  on undefined values and direct object rendering in JSX were fixed. The recurring render is not a function error was systematically debugged and determined to be intermittent. The Aksaray city filtering issue was resolved by correcting MongoDB queries and implementing case-insensitive filtering. The Admin Panel gained a Business Management tab with server-side filtering. Finally, a comprehensive customer profile system (password change, address management, payment methods, coupons, discounts, campaigns) was implemented in the frontend and backend, although the address adding functionality was reported as not working and the cart flow needs further enhancement.

<product_requirements>
Kuryecini is a full-stack food and package delivery platform for the Turkish market, supporting Customer, Courier, Business, and Admin roles. It features role-specific dashboards, a complete customer order flow, courier tracking, and business management. The application uses MongoDB, JWT authentication (httpOnly, Secure cookies), and CSRF protection. A future goal is a native Android app via PWA/TWA.

Current implementation includes: production readiness, public menus, address management, courier KYC, Leaflet maps, order commission, JWT role-based admin login, CI/CD, OpenAPI, frontend error handling,  theming, accessibility, performance, JWT refresh, rate limiting, and comprehensive tests. Recent additions include a Forgot Password flow, business city normalization, customer address-based restaurant listing, and a full customer food ordering system (menu, cart, profile, order history).

The new, ongoing objective is to redesign the customer application with a Trendyol Go-like bottom tab navigation: Discover (location-based restaurant discovery), Cart, Orders, and Profile. The Profile section is to have sub-tabs for My Info, My Coupons, My Discounts, Campaigns, and My Payment Methods. Payment options include online (Iyzico Sandbox, token-based) and cash/POS on delivery. A post-delivery review system for couriers and businesses (1-5 stars, comments) is also required. Backend updates include new models and endpoints for coupons, discounts, campaigns, payment methods, and reviews. Backend queries need case-insensitive city filtering.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on completing the comprehensive customer application redesign, which is part of Phase 3: Customer Profile System Development.

Specifically, the user reported that the Adres ekle kısmı çalışmıyor (add address part is not working) in the  and requested further enhancements to the cart approval flow, including detailed payment options (Online, Kapıda Nakit, Kapıda Pos).

The AI engineer acknowledged these issues and has started addressing them:
1.  **Address Management**: The AI engineer began by adding the necessary address modal and handler functions () to  to enable adding addresses. The next step is to implement edit, delete, and selection of addresses for use in the Keşfet (Discover) page.
2.  **Cart Approval and Payment Flow**: This part has been acknowledged but work has not yet started in the code.

The backend endpoints for address management (, , , ) have already been implemented in  as part of Phase 3. The current focus is on connecting these backend functionalities to the  frontend and enhancing the cart flow.
