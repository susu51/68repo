The trajectory details the development of the Kuryecini food delivery app, split into two main phases. Phase 1 focused on fully implementing the Admin Panel, which involved creating comprehensive CRUD APIs for Orders, Businesses, Menus, Couriers, Settings, Promotions, and Reports, along with a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system in the backend. The frontend  was also completely rewritten to integrate these new modules and fix a critical syntax error from previous work. Backend testing for Phase 1 showed a 74.4% success rate, with RBAC security confirmed.

Phase 2 tackled the customer-facing Cart and Payment flow. This involved building mock payment APIs, creating new frontend components (, , ), and integrating them with , , and . Significant debugging was required for frontend issues, including an  undefined error and delivery address not selected on the payment page. A critical API endpoint mismatch ( vs ) was also resolved.

The subsequent E2E integration involved making business menus visible to customers, routing orders to the business panel for approval, and pushing ready orders to couriers. This required updating both frontend dashboards (, ) and backend order APIs to use real data and status transitions. Backend E2E tests achieved a 95% success rate.

The most challenging issue was a persistent  in the frontend. After multiple attempts to debug context usage and component structure, a  was engaged, which identified the root cause as a React version conflict:  requiring React 19.0.0 while the environment used React 18.3.1. Removing  resolved this critical rendering error. The work concluded with a comprehensive backend test revealing a critical RBAC bypass issue on , which was immediately fixed.

<product_requirements>
Kuryecini is a full-stack food and package delivery platform for the Turkish market, supporting Customer, Courier, Business, and Admin roles. It features a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

The application currently supports:
-   **Customer App**: Restaurant discovery (location-aware, city-based filtering), dynamic menu display, comprehensive user profile with address CRUD.
-   **Admin Panel (Phase 1 Completed)**: A central interface for platform administrators with a dashboard and dedicated sections for managing Business and Courier KYC applications. This phase was extended to include full CRUD functionalities for Orders, Businesses, Menus, Couriers, Settings, Promotions, and Reports, along with a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. All admin changes must reflect instantly in customer/business views.
-   **Customer Cart & Payment (Phase 2 Completed)**: A complete flow from discovering a product, adding it to the cart, selecting an address, mock payment options (Online, Cash, POS), order creation, and status tracking.
-   **E2E Order Flow**: Business menus are visible to customers, orders are sent to the business panel for approval, and upon setting an order to ready, it's dispatched to a courier.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frameworks**: React.js (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend).
-   **Database**: MongoDB (UUIDs used for IDs, not ObjectIDs).
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Admin, Business Owner, Courier, Customer roles.
-   **Key Challenges Resolved**: Data inconsistency across MongoDB collections, frontend state management for dynamic filtering, critical React component syntax errors, React version dependency conflicts (React-Leaflet).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard monolithic repository structure with  and  directories.

<current_work>
The most recent work involved a comprehensive E2E integration of the order flow, covering customer, business, and courier roles. This included making business menus visible to customers, ensuring orders land in the business panel for approval, and enabling the Ready button to push orders to the courier system.

Backend APIs were updated in  to handle real business orders (fetching incoming, updating status to , , ) and courier order assignments (fetching available orders, picking up). Frontend dashboards (, ) were refactored to consume these new APIs, replacing previous mock data. The  now dynamically displays order status buttons (Accept, Prepare, Ready for Courier) and the  lists orders available for pickup.

Following this, a persistent  error was encountered in the frontend. After extensive debugging attempts by the AI engineer involving Context Providers (, ) and component refactoring (, ), the  was invoked. The root cause was identified as a React version incompatibility:  required React 19.0.0, but the current environment ran React 18.3.1, leading to a corrupted React bundle. The  dependency was successfully removed to resolve this.

The work concluded with a comprehensive backend test that achieved an 89.5% success rate but critically identified an RBAC bypass vulnerability in the  endpoint due to an import error. This critical security flaw was immediately patched by commenting out the problematic import. The system is now preparing for a comprehensive frontend test as requested by the user.
