<analysis>
The AI engineer's work on the Kuryecini application has spanned several critical areas, primarily focusing on integrating an AI Diagnostics panel and subsequently stabilizing core application functionalities. Initially, the Ops Co-Pilot (AI Assistant) with its 7-block structured response format was integrated into the FastAPI backend and React frontend. This involved creating new backend modules for context building, LLM providers, and API routes, as well as new frontend components and API clients.

A significant portion of the work involved debugging existing application issues, often prompted by the Ops Co-Pilot's diagnostic reports, which were frequently found to be partially accurate but lacking deep system context. This led to resolving critical frontend issues like double JSON parsing, infinite rendering loops, and authentication synchronization problems. Backend issues, such as incorrect data filtering and UUID handling for business entities, were also identified and fixed. The engineer has demonstrated an iterative problem-solving approach, utilizing testing agents and manual code inspection to address reported problems. The immediate focus is on resolving a persistent WebSocket disconnection issue, which the user reported again despite previous fixes.

<product_requirements>
The Kuryecini platform is a multi-role (Customer, Business, Courier, Admin) application built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, designed for real-time, end-to-end order management. Key existing features include real-time order routing, notifications for Admin/Business panels, customer order placement, business order approval, and a Courier Waiting Tasks panel.

The primary new feature is a secure, multi-app AI Diagnostics panel for the Admin Panel. This panel aims to aggregate logs, redact PII, classify errors, perform Root Cause Analysis (RCA), and propose fixes with code patches using an LLM. It requires backend models, an ingestion API, and a React/Tailwind frontend. The AI Assistant component within this panel needs to be panel-aware (customer, business, courier, multi), support time windows, preset questions, context toggles (metrics, logs), streaming markdown output, and integrate with either an Emergent LLM Key or a custom OpenAI API key. Crucially, it must provide structured responses (Diagnosis, RCA, Solutions, Patch, Tests, Monitoring, DoD) and leverage advanced code exploration tools (list_files, grep, ast_outline) for context. The current work specifically focuses on hardening the Kuryecini Ops Co-Pilot with its master system prompt and tool calling capabilities for the AI Assistant.

-   ****: The main FastAPI application.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to correctly handle logging using  instead of  for order creation. Crucially, a duplicate  endpoint was found and the earlier one (line 4850) was fixed to return the UUID uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) of businesses instead of the MongoDB  to resolve menu loading issues. Also added  endpoint.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a multi-faceted debugging effort to resolve several user-reported and test-identified issues, despite previous claims of full functionality. The primary immediate focus is on resolving a persistent WebSocket disconnection problem.

The engineer addressed the following critical issues:
1.  **Frontend Authentication Sync**: Fixed double JSON parsing in  that prevented user sessions from synchronizing correctly after login, blocking access to customer panels.
2.  **Menu API 404 / Business ID Mismatch**:
    *   Added a compatible backend endpoint for the menu API ().
    *   **Crucially**, identified and fixed a bug in  where the  endpoint (specifically, the earlier-defined route) was incorrectly returning MongoDB's  as the uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) for businesses instead of the intended UUID uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) field. This caused frontend menu requests to fail as they were using the wrong ID type.
    *   Ensured business data in the database had  fields to prevent filtering issues.
3.  **RestaurantMenu Infinite Loop**: Fixed a rendering loop in  caused by incorrect  dependencies and state updates.
4.  **Backend Order Logging**: Implemented proper Python logging in  for order creation, replacing previous  statements, as identified by an Ops Co-Pilot report.
5.  **WebSocket Connection Stability**: Fixed a backend message loop issue in  and a frontend URL parsing error in .

Despite these fixes, the user has explicitly reported that the Websocet bağlantısı sürekli kesiliyor (WebSocket connection is constantly disconnecting), indicating that the problem is not fully resolved. A screenshot provided by the user shows a Bağlan (Connect) button, suggesting the frontend is attempting to reconnect. The engineer's current thought process is to investigate the frontend for heartbeat/ping mechanisms, as the backend's message loop and basic WebSocket handling have already been addressed.

Investigate the frontend's  for WebSocket heartbeat/ping mechanisms or re-connection logic to prevent disconnections.
