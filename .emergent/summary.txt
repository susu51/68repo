The AI engineer's work primarily focused on migrating the application from mock data/ to a fully database-driven, authenticated system, as per strict new project requirements (CI Gate 0). This involved extensive refactoring of frontend components (, customer pages, , ) to use a centralized  and . Backend routes were updated to use real MongoDB queries, especially for business, orders, and content.

Significant challenges included persistent frontend compile errors due to syntax issues and misplaced imports, requiring meticulous debugging. Database inconsistencies were a recurring theme, where endpoints incorrectly queried  or  collections, or expected differing field names (uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) vs ,  vs ), leading to Not found or Not authenticated errors in addresses, nearby businesses, and KYC. A critical security flaw was identified and resolved: pending KYC businesses could access system resources; this was fixed by implementing a  dependency. The trajectory concludes with the engineer addressing a user-reported KYC approval failure, having refactored the frontend KYC component and aligned backend response formats, and is now poised to re-test the KYC approval flow.

Kuryecini is a full-stack food/package delivery platform for the Turkish market, supporting Customer, Courier, Business, and Admin roles using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The core functionality includes real MongoDB, JWT-based RBAC, real-time communication, and OpenStreetMap. Admin Panel features robust KYC. Customer App offers location-aware discovery and real-time order tracking. Business Panel manages orders and menus. Courier App handles tracking and deliveries.

Recent strict requirements, enforced by a CI Gate system, demand:
- Elimination of all mock data/ usage.
- Strict JWT-based RBAC across all roles.
- TR localization via .
- Redesigned Admin Panel with dynamic widgets (Popular Products, AdBoards) from .
- Visual enhancements for Register screens and dedicated Hubs using .
- Specific API contracts for business menu, nearby businesses, admin settings, and auth.
- Mandatory Playwright E2E tests for key flows.
- Strict implementation order: Content & Media seed, ContentEditor/Admin Dashboard, Register pages, Customer Landing/Nearby, Settings/Courier/Earn integration, Playwright tests.

The application uses a monolithic repository with  (React) and  (FastAPI).



-   ****: Central API logic. Updated to integrate new route modules, and modified for mock data removal (business stats, payment), and KYC management endpoints. Auth logic was adjusted for test users.
-   ****: Centralizes authentication. Modified to include  for KYC enforcement.
-   ****: Business-related routes.  logic updated to query  collection for business info.
-   ****: Geospatial queries. Logic updated for  and  to query  collection.
-   ** (NEW)**: Provides API endpoints for  CRUD operations, essential for the new Content Editor.
-   ** (NEW)**: Script to seed initial  and  into MongoDB.
-   ****: Root component. Heavily refactored to remove  for auth, integrating  and . Fixed various syntax errors and import placements. Also includes , , .
-   ****: Admin interface. Integrated  into its navigation and main view.
-   ****: Business interface. Extensively refactored to remove all  usage, replacing direct  calls with  and  hook. This addressed the session expired error during business login.
-   ** (NEW)**: Created to centralize JWT token management and user authentication state, replacing . Integrates with .
-   ** (NEW)**: Component for admin to manage , including drag&drop functionality for sections and interactive popular products editing.
-   ****: KYC approval/rejection logic. Refactored to remove  and  API calls, integrating  and . Backend response handling adjusted for  field.
-   ** (NEW)**: Centralized utility for making authenticated API requests, managing JWT token, and handling 401 (unauthorized) errors.
-   ** (e.g., , , , )**: All customer-facing pages were refactored to remove  usage and integrate  for API calls. URL mismatches for addresses were fixed.

- Implement ContentEditor for Register pages.
- Integrate Customer Landing and Nearby businesses with dynamic content.
- Implement Settings reading and Courier/Earn integration.
- Write and pass Playwright E2E tests for all new features.
- Address any remaining  or  usages, as CI Gate 0 is 95% but not 100% compliant.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user report that İşletme kyc başarısız oluyor onaylanmiyor (Business KYC fails, not being approved).

The AI engineer has performed the following actions related to this:
1.  **Frontend Refactoring ()**: Cleaned up the  component by replacing  and direct  API calls with the new  hook and  utility. This ensures consistent authentication and API handling.
2.  **Backend Response Alignment**: Modified the backend  and  endpoints in  to return a  field. This was necessary because the frontend's  component was expecting this field for success validation, which was previously missing.
3.  **Authentication Check**: Verified that admin login is successful and can retrieve pending businesses.

The current state is that the technical fixes (frontend code and backend response format) for the KYC approval process have been implemented. The AI engineer has successfully logged in as an admin and listed pending businesses. The immediate next action is to attempt to approve one of these businesses to verify the fix.
