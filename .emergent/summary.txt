The trajectory details the work of an AI engineer on the DeliverTR application, starting from an MVP and extending its features. Initially, the engineer fixed a Python syntax error in . Following user feedback, an attempt was made to migrate the authentication system from email/password to phone/SMS OTP. This implementation failed backend tests, leading to a user-requested rollback to the robust email/password system, which was then re-implemented with comprehensive courier registration, including file uploads and KYC fields.

Subsequently, the core application flow was developed: Business role product/menu management, Customer product viewing/ordering, a basic order lifecycle (CREATED → ASSIGNED → ON_ROUTE → DELIVERED), and Admin management with a dedicated login. Map integration using Leaflet/OpenStreetMap was also added. After fixing a minor frontend error in the Admin Dashboard, the engineer implemented a full KYC approval system within the Admin panel, allowing viewing of courier documents and approval/rejection. Responsive design was also introduced. The trajectory concludes with the engineer addressing user-reported issues: persistent approved couriers in the KYC list, Admin panel layout issues, and a request for a modern Customer Dashboard design, currently stalled by a JSX error during the Customer Dashboard refactor.

<product_requirements>
DeliverTR is a package/food delivery platform for Turkey, using an anyone can be a courier model. It supports Customer, Courier, and Business roles, with a 3% platform commission. The default language is Turkish, timezone Europe/Istanbul.

**Implemented Features (as per trajectory):**
*   **User Authentication & Registration**: Email/Password system with JWT, supporting detailed registration for Customer, Courier (including IBAN, vehicle type, driver's license, vehicle registration, profile photo uploads, city, requiring admin KYC approval), and Business (name, tax ID, address, menu management, package type).
*   **Admin Panel**: Basic KYC approval (view documents, approve/reject), user management, product/order management. Admin login via password 6851.
*   **Core Order Flow**: Map integration (Leaflet/OpenStreetMap), basic order creation, order acceptance by approved couriers. Real-time updates via WebSockets.
*   **Content Management**: Business menu creation (category, product, description, price, photo, prep time).
*   **Package Orders**: Input for package details (weight/size, sensitive/cold chain, priority, floor, notes).
*   **Courier Balance**: Display of courier earnings.
*   **Responsive Design**: Admin, Courier, and Customer dashboards adapted for mobile views.

**MVP Criteria (User confirmed):**
*   **Authentication**: Phone + SMS (JWT-based session) with +90 format. Email optional for notifications/password reset. (Note: This was *attempted* but reverted to email/password due to implementation issues.)
*   **Roles**: Courier, Business, Customer, Admin.
*   **KYC**: Courier document upload (license, registration), admin approval required for orders.
*   **Business**: Menu/product addition (name, price, duration, photo).
*   **Customer**: Cart, order creation (static address initially).
*   **Courier**: Nearby orders list, accepts within 5-7 km.
*   **Order Statuses**: Created → Assigned → On_Route → Delivered.
*   **Commission**: 3% platform fee (pseudo calculation before Iyzico).
*   **Admin**: KYC approval/rejection, user management, basic order list.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing several issues reported by the user after implementing core features, KYC, and responsive design.

The work sequence was:
1.  **KYC Filtering Fix**: The engineer attempted to fix the issue where approved couriers were not disappearing from the Admin Dashboard's KYC Onay tab. This involved modifying the logic within the  component, specifically the  function and potentially the  to ensure the list updates correctly after an approval or rejection. (Chat Message 237, 238, 239, 240)
2.  **Courier Dashboard KYC Integration**: The  was updated to incorporate the KYC approval status, likely to conditionally enable/disable functionalities (e.g., accepting orders) based on whether the courier's KYC is approved. (Chat Message 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248)
3.  **Customer Dashboard Redesign**: The user requested a more modern, technological, yet simple interface for the Customer Dashboard. The engineer started redesigning the  component. During this refactoring, a JSX parsing error () was introduced, which is the immediate blocking issue. (Chat Message 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254)

The current state is that the backend and most frontend components are functional, including email/password authentication, detailed courier registration, admin panel with KYC approval, product/order management, and responsive design. However, the  is broken due to a syntax error, preventing the application from fully loading after the most recent changes.

<optional_next_step>
Fix the JSX parsing error in the  component and continue its redesign.
