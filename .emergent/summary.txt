The AI engineer has significantly evolved the Kuryecini application, transforming it from a mock-data-driven MVP to a more robust, database-backed, and authenticated system. The journey began with a focus on migrating away from  and mock data, establishing a JWT-based RBAC, and setting up core functionalities. Key challenges included persistent frontend compilation errors, database schema mismatches (e.g.,  vs uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),  vs  collections), and authentication issues, particularly around KYC enforcement.

The trajectory shows meticulous debugging and refactoring across both frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI, MongoDB). Major accomplishments include implementing a Content Editor, fixing business menu persistence, establishing a basic customer address management system, and updating the application's visual identity with a new logo. The AI engineer is currently in Phase 2C, focusing on integrating third-party services like Sentry, having successfully eliminated most mock data and integrated real MongoDB endpoints. The ongoing work is to integrate Sentry based on a provided playbook.

<product_requirements>
Kuryecini is a full-stack food/package delivery platform for the Turkish market, supporting Customer, Courier, Business, and Admin roles using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The core functionality includes real MongoDB, JWT-based RBAC, real-time communication, and OpenStreetMap.

Recent strict CI Gate 0 requirements demand:
- Elimination of all mock data/ usage.
- Strict JWT-based RBAC.
- TR localization via .
- Redesigned Admin Panel with dynamic , ,  widgets from .
- Visual enhancements for Register pages using  (, , ).
- Specific API contracts for business menu, nearby businesses, admin settings, and auth.
- Mandatory Playwright E2E tests.
- Specific implementation order for features (Content & Media seed, ContentEditor/Admin Dashboard, Register pages, Customer Landing/Nearby, Settings/Courier/Earn integration, Playwright tests).

Additional functional requests from the user:
- Business menus should be visible to nearby customers, with a city-wide fallback.
- Current Location option for customer address selection.
- Automated order flow: Customer orders -> payment -> approval -> business sees Ready, awaiting courier -> order drops to courier -> courier accepts, sees route -> courier delivers -> earnings record created.
- A modern login screen should be the primary entry point, with the old homepage available but only featuring the modern login option.
- A professionally designed Kuryecini logo should be integrated across the application.
- Integrate Sentry (error/log monitoring), Email/SMS provider stub (notification tests), and OSRM_URL route engine.

<pending_tasks>
- Integrate Customer Landing and Nearby businesses with dynamic content.
- Implement Settings reading and Courier/Earn integration (specifically, earnings record creation after courier delivery).
- Write and pass Playwright E2E tests for all new features.
- Integrate remaining 3rd party services: Email/SMS provider stub, OSRM_URL route engine.
- Implement Current Location option for customer address selection.
- Complete the automated order workflow from customer order to courier delivery and review.
- Address any further  or  usages if they are re-introduced or missed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was continuing with **Phase 2C: 3rd Party Integrations**. This phase focuses on integrating external services as per user requirements (Sentry, Email/SMS Provider stub, OSRM_URL).

The specific task being worked on is the **integration of Sentry** for error and log monitoring in the backend. The AI engineer successfully requested and received a detailed Sentry integration playbook from the  sub-agent. Following this, a new file, , was created. The current action is to proceed with installing Sentry dependencies in the backend according to the playbook.

The application has a modern login screen and a functional homepage, with a newly designed Kuryecini logo integrated. Business menu creation is persistent and visible to customers. Customer address management (CRUD operations) is also functional. KYC approval for businesses and basic order creation are working, but the full end-to-end order workflow (business approval, courier assignment, delivery, earnings, customer review) still requires complete integration and testing.
