The previous AI engineer diligently enhanced the Kuryecini application, focusing on critical UI/UX and core functionality. Initially, work involved fixing login components, implementing a gradient-based login UI with OAuth/phone placeholders, and integrating site-wide dark/light mode (excluding specific panels). Routing for  was resolved. Key feature additions included menu item image uploads for businesses, smart restaurant filtering on the customer discover page by city/district and GPS, and fixing business KYC approval processes.

Significant effort was dedicated to resolving issues with GPS coordinates for business discoverability, full address display in the customer panel, and a complex multi-turn debugging process to fix the end-to-end cart and order flow. This involved correcting frontend  hook integration, backend order creation (handling  vs uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) and  vs  collections), and ensuring orders correctly appear in business and courier panels by adjusting API responses and status filters. An Admin Settings page with maintenance mode was also implemented. The work shows an iterative, problem-solving approach to user feedback.

The Kuryecini platform is a modern, role-based application (Customer, Business, Courier, Admin) built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. It features address management with geocoding, distance-based restaurant discovery, and real-time order processing. The Business Panel manages menus, orders, and regions.

Recent implementation priorities include:
-   **Detailed Registration:** Multi-step, role-specific forms with KYC document uploads and admin approval.
-   **Advertisement System:** City-filtered, auto-sliding ad banners for customers, managed via an Admin panel.
-   **Login/Registration UX:** Modern login modal (email, phone, OAuth), dedicated registration page with specific visual styles and new tab functionality.
-   **Global Theme & UI:** Site-wide dark/light mode, with forced light mode for customer panels and landing page.
-   **Menu Management:** Businesses must upload images for menu items.
-   **Restaurant Discovery:** Customer panel displays businesses in the same city/district, sorted smartly (10km with GPS, 50km without). Full addresses should be visible in the customer discover section.
-   **Admin Settings:** Implement a comprehensive settings panel including maintenance mode.
-   **Order Flow:** Ensure add-to-cart, order confirmation, and payment flow work correctly, and that placed orders are visible in the respective business and courier panels.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Authentication**: JWT, secure cookies, role-based access control.
-   **UI/Styling**: Tailwind CSS, React Context API for theme, gradient designs.
-   **Routing**: React Router DOM.
-   **State Management**: React hooks (, , , ).
-   **Geocoding/Location**: Distance-based and city/district filtering for restaurants.
-   **Database Interaction**: MongoDB with UUIDs for IDs, not ObjectIDs.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a standard MERN-like stack: React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.



**Key Files and Changes:**
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Central FastAPI application.
    -   **Changes**: Added  utility endpoint for development. Added  and  for Admin panel control. Introduced a public endpoint  for fetching menus. Modified  for correct product ID lookup. Updated order processing and business order fetching logic (multiple locations in the file were found to have similar endpoints, leading to confusion and duplicate logic). Corrected  and uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) usage in  and  endpoints to ensure business orders display correctly with uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) and  in responses.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Handles address management endpoints for users.
    -   **Changes**: Confirmed  (full address) field presence, ensuring backend supports full address storage and retrieval.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Business-specific API routes.
    -   **Changes**: Modified  to insert menu items into  with both  and uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) fields to be compatible with public menu endpoints.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Provides city and location-based catalog filtering.
    -   **Changes**: Made  and  parameters optional in  and added conditional logic to allow city/district-only filtering without GPS.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main application component, handles routing and global context.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated  component. Added logic to redirect to  if maintenance mode is active. Wrapped  with . Defined  component.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Customer-facing page for discovering restaurants.
    -   **Changes**: Updated address display to show full address using . Integrated  hook for add-to-cart functionality. Changed to use the new  endpoint for restaurant listing.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main container for customer-specific routes and functionality.
    -   **Changes**: Modified  to correctly format order data using  and to align with backend  model. Updated toast messages for clarity.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Displays the customer's cart and initiates checkout.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected usage of  object to access  for rendering cart contents, fixing a type mismatch issue.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Component for selecting and managing delivery addresses.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected API endpoints for fetching and saving addresses to . Updated address saving logic to match backend schema.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   **Summary**: New component created to manage administrative settings, including maintenance mode.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   **Summary**: New page to display a maintenance message when the application is in maintenance mode.
-   ****: Continuously updated with implementation status, bug fixes, feature additions, and test results.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into debugging a critical issue where placed orders were not appearing in the relevant business's order management panel. The problem was traced through several layers, including initial issues with menu item creation (not persisting to the database, or incorrect uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) vs  usage), then order creation (orders not saving to the database despite a 200 OK response from the backend), and finally, the display of existing orders in the business panel.

The latest findings indicated that orders *are* now being saved to the database, but the business panel's API endpoints () were not correctly retrieving or formatting the  in their responses. This resulted in orders appearing as  or not being visible to the correct business user. The engineer identified a specific endpoint at  line 1621 responsible for fetching incoming business orders and made a modification to ensure  is included in the response and that uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) is used consistently for lookups. The current state is that this fix has been applied to , the backend has been restarted, and the next step is to test this modification.
