The Kuryecini project has undergone substantial development, evolving from foundational UI/UX and backend endpoint additions into a feature-rich full-stack platform. Initially, the AI engineer resolved extensive frontend debugging issues like  on undefined values and React object-as-child errors. A major architectural shift migrated persistent state from  to MongoDB with secure  cookie-based JWT authentication and CSRF protection.

Subsequent work focused on addressing 26 detailed requirements in phases, including standardizing deployment, environment variables, health checks, CORS, public menus, address management, courier KYC, Leaflet maps, and a commission system. The AI engineer successfully implemented a Forgot/Reset Password flow, city normalization for business registration, and initial customer address management with location-based restaurant listing.

Recent efforts primarily involved debugging a persistent MongoDB authentication failure during deployment, which led to significant refactoring of backend environment variable usage and database connection logic. Further fixes addressed React rendering errors (Objects are not valid as a React child) in Business and Admin panels, and a  error. The most immediate challenge is a JWT token validation issue and user ID mismatch in the backend, preventing customer addresses from being fetched and displayed correctly on the frontend, necessitating temporary hardcoded fixes for debugging. The frontend consistently fails to log in after restarts, impacting further testing.

<product_requirements>
Kuryecini is a full-stack food and package delivery platform for the Turkish market, supporting Customer, Courier, Business, and Admin roles. Core features include role-specific dashboards, a customer order flow (menu browsing, cart, order placement), courier delivery via maps, and business management/analytics. The architecture transitioned from client-side  to server-side MongoDB state with JWT (,  cookies) and CSRF protection. Future plans include a native Android app using PWA/TWA. Requirements span production readiness (deployment, env vars, health checks, CORS), public menus, address management, secure courier KYC with uploads, Leaflet map integration, order commission system, secure JWT role-based admin login, CI/CD, OpenAPI docs, frontend error/empty states,  theming, accessibility, performance (lazy loading), robust error handling, JWT refresh, rate limiting, logging, and comprehensive tests. Recent additions include a Forgot Password flow, business city normalization, and customer address-based restaurant listing.

<current_work>
The most recent work focused on implementing customer address management and location-based restaurant listing. This involved creating new frontend pages (, , ) and integrating them into . Backend API endpoints for  and  were added and refined, leveraging existing business listing logic and city normalization.

However, several critical issues emerged during testing:
1.  **Frontend Login Failures**: After restarts, the frontend often fails to retain login state, reverting to the homepage or login page, which hinders testing of authenticated routes like .
2.  ** for Address API Calls**: Despite a successful login (when it works), API calls from the frontend to  consistently returned  errors.
3.  **JWT Token Key Inconsistency**: Initially, the  was trying to retrieve a generic  from , while the actual token was stored under  by the main authentication system. This was rectified in .
4.  **Backend User ID Mismatch**: The primary cause of the  errors for address operations was traced to a mismatch in user identification. The JWT  field contained the user's email, but the backend's  function (and subsequent database queries) expected a different format of user ID (e.g., ). This led to the system failing to find a valid user associated with the token.
5.  **Temporary Hardcoded Fix**: To diagnose further, the AI introduced a temporary hardcoded  in  and  functions in . This allowed the backend API to successfully add and retrieve addresses for this specific ID.
6.  ** Error in Address Processing**: An issue was found where  data could be  when processing addresses, causing a  object error during data transformation. This was fixed by adding safe checks.

Currently, the backend successfully returns address data (with the temporary hardcoded user ID), but the frontend still shows Henüz kayıtlı adresiniz yok due to persistent frontend login issues after application restarts, preventing proper display and interaction.

<optional_next_step>
Force a successful customer login on the frontend to verify if the addresses are now displayed correctly and if new addresses can be added without  errors.
