The AI engineer's trajectory details a complex development cycle for the Kuryecini application, primarily focusing on two major features: a comprehensive, pixel-perfect landing page and a robust HttpOnly cookie-based JWT authentication system. Initial efforts were marred by a persistent  hardcoding issue across various frontend files, which was progressively resolved. The agent successfully implemented a modern authentication flow, including dark/light modes and Google OAuth (though image generation for the landing page was later reverted to stock photos due to  limitations with Gemini image generation). This modern auth was temporarily reverted to an older system per user request, before a completely new, pixel-perfect landing page was implemented.

A significant portion of the work involved extensive debugging of authentication and role-based access. This included fixing backend issues such as incomplete user lookup functions, a critical JWT secret key mismatch between  and , and ensuring frontend components (, , , ) correctly used the new cookie-based auth and environment variables, replacing deprecated patterns. User feedback consistently highlighted login failures, leading to deep dives,  invocations, and fixes for customer, admin, and business dashboards. The trajectory ends with the user reporting a persistent registration part is not working issue, indicating that a core onboarding functionality remains broken.

<product_requirements>
Kuryecini is a Turkish food/package delivery platform designed for Customer, Courier, Business, and Admin roles, aiming for production deployment. The architecture mandates a React frontend, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL (target database, currently MongoDB), HttpOnly cookie-based JWT authentication with refresh tokens, RBAC, Sentry, Docker, and Playwright E2E tests. Key constraints include strict prohibition of / and  usage, enforcement of  for passwords, and RBAC implementation.

Features implemented or in progress based on the trajectory:
*   **Authentication Overhaul:** Transitioned from  to HttpOnly cookie-based JWT, including Google OAuth integration. Significant effort has been put into debugging and stabilizing this across customer, admin, and business roles, with consistent user reports of issues (e.g., login not working, dashboards not opening).
*   **City-Strict Catalog Rules:** Implemented location-based business discovery, though its direct implementation was not a focus of the *provided* trajectory.
*   **Address Management:** Enhanced CRUD operations for customer addresses, also not a direct focus of this trajectory.
*   **UI/UX Improvements:** The Kuryecini logo was consistently integrated. A modern, pixel-perfect landing page was designed and implemented according to detailed specifications, including responsive layouts, specific color palettes, typography, and sections like Hero, Statistics, Why Us, Courier Vehicle Flexibility (with images), Testimonials, Trust, and Footer.
*   **Login/Registration UI:** A modern login/registration screen with dark/light mode, Email, Google, and Apple (disabled) tabs was implemented. The Telefon login option was explicitly removed. This entire modern auth screen was then reverted to an older version upon user request, and then further refined for error handling and proper redirection to dashboards.

<pending_tasks>
-   **CI Gate 0 Completion**: Fully audit and remove any remaining , , , ,  patterns.
-   **Backend Migration**: Transition from MongoDB to PostgreSQL.
-   **Fix Registration Flow**: The user explicitly stated, kayıt ol kısmı çalışmıyor (registration part is not working), which is the most immediate and critical pending task.

<current_work>
Immediately before the last user message, the AI engineer was debugging issues with product saving for business users. This involved identifying and fixing a JWT secret key mismatch between  and  in the backend, and ensuring the  frontend API utility correctly parsed JSON responses. After these fixes, a new login was performed to get a fresh token, but the user then reported kayıtlar başarısız (registrations failed). The AI engineer, using the troubleshoot agent, initially identified a Database Empty Issue and registration layer problems, but upon checking MongoDB, confirmed that 53 users existed and the business user () was active and approved. The AI engineer was in the process of re-examining backend logs for the  call when the user's latest, more general complaint (kayıt ol kısmı çalışmıyor - registration part is not working) came in, shifting the focus back to the core registration process.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix the user registration flow, specifically addressing why kayıt ol kısmı çalışmıyor.
