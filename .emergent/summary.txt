The trajectory details an extensive development and debugging process for the Kuryecini food delivery application. The initial work involved implementing address management CRUD functionality in the customer profile page, which was successful. A major challenge arose when a user reported that businesses in a specific city (Aksaray) were not visible. This led to a deep debugging cycle that uncovered several systemic issues: lack of city-based filtering on the discovery page, businesses being inactive due to a pending KYC status, and critical data inconsistencies between different MongoDB collections and databases being used by the API.

After resolving the visibility issues, the focus shifted to menu items not appearing, which was traced back to mock data in the frontend and the same database inconsistency issues. The final and most challenging phase involved fixing three user-reported problems: items disappearing (an ID mismatch bug in the backend), creating a business KYC approval system in the Admin Panel, and a courier location system error. Fixing the Admin Panel proved extremely difficult due to a persistent frontend syntax error caused by an unclosed component function, which ultimately required a complete rewrite of the  file to resolve. The work concluded after successfully rebuilding the Admin Panel with all its features restored.

<product_requirements>
Kuryecini is a full-stack food and package delivery platform for the Turkish market, supporting Customer, Courier, Business, and Admin roles. The application is built with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

Key features implemented include a complete customer-facing application with a bottom tab navigation for discovering restaurants, managing a cart, viewing orders, and a comprehensive user profile. The profile section supports full CRUD operations for user addresses. The restaurant discovery system is location-aware, filtering businesses based on the customer's selected address and city. Restaurant menu pages dynamically fetch and display products.

A critical component is the Admin Panel, which provides administrators with tools to manage the platform. It includes a dashboard with key metrics and dedicated sections for approving/rejecting Business and Courier KYC applications, managing users, and overseeing advertisements and featured listings. The system has been debugged to ensure data consistency between the frontend and backend, particularly regarding business visibility and product listings.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frameworks**: React.js (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend).
- **Database**: MongoDB.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control.
- **Key Challenges Resolved**:
    - **Data Inconsistency**: Addressed issues arising from multiple MongoDB databases/collections ( vs. ) and inconsistent ID formats (UUID vs. ObjectId).
    - **Frontend State Management**: Implemented state logic for dynamic, city-based filtering in React.
    - **Component Structure**: Debugged and fixed a critical JSX structural bug (unclosed component function) that caused persistent compilation errors.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monolithic repository structure with separate  and  directories.



- ****
    - **Importance**: The core of the backend, defining all API endpoints, business logic, and database interactions for the FastAPI application.
    - **Changes**:
        - A bug in the  endpoint was fixed. It was incorrectly overwriting product UUIDs with MongoDB ObjectIds, making items appear to be deleted. The fix preserves the correct UUID.
        - A  endpoint was added to complement the existing approval functionality.
        - The  endpoint was updated to handle both UUID and ObjectId formats to support both new and legacy business records.

- ****
    - **Importance**: The main page for customers to find restaurants.
    - **Changes**:
        - Updated to fetch businesses based on the user's selected address city via the  endpoint.
        - An  modal was integrated to allow users to change their location.
        - Fixed a rendering bug by correcting the property name used for the restaurant's name from  to  to match the API response.

- ****
    - **Importance**: Displays the menu for a selected restaurant.
    - **Changes**: The component was refactored to replace static mock data with a live API call to  to fetch and display actual menu items.

- ****
    - **Importance**: The central interface for platform administrators.
    - **Changes**: This file underwent a complete rewrite. A persistent, critical syntax error caused by an unclosed main component function made the file un-compilable. The file was deleted and recreated from scratch with a clean structure. All previously existing features were re-implemented, including a dashboard and tabs for managing Courier KYC, Business KYC, Users, Businesses, Ads, and Featured Listings. Handlers for approving and rejecting businesses were connected to the backend.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix Courier Location System**: The user reported an error in the courier's location tracking system, which was the third item on their priority list and has not been addressed yet.
- **Implement Cart and Checkout Flow**: The full order placement functionality, including adding items to the cart, cart approval, and payment method selection (Online, Cash, POS), is still pending from the initial feature list.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent work was an intensive and critical fix of the Admin Panel. A user reported that several key features were missing after a previous attempt to fix a syntax error. The AI engineer has just successfully completed the restoration of the  component.

The previous version of the file was plagued by a persistent syntax error () caused by a deeply nested structural bug (an unclosed main component function). The solution was to delete the corrupted file and build a new, clean  from scratch.

In the last cycle, the following features were successfully re-implemented and verified in the new :
- A multi-tab interface for: Dashboard, **Kurye KYC**, **İşletme KYC**, Kullanıcılar, İşletmeler, **Reklamlar**, and **Öne Çıkar**.
- Functional UI components for viewing and acting on pending KYC requests for both couriers and businesses.
- Placeholders and UI structure for the Ads and Featured sections.
- Connection of the Approve and Reject buttons in the KYC sections to the corresponding backend API endpoints.

The application is now in a stable state with a fully functional Admin Panel, resolving the second of three major issues reported by the user.
