The AI engineer's work trajectory outlines a phased development approach for the Kuryecini application, moving from a completed Courier Panel (Phase 1) to a detailed Customer Panel (Phase 2), and then an unexpected mid-trajectory pivot to a comprehensive refactor of Address/GPS/Discovery/Order Flow, followed by a Business Panel overhaul. Key challenges included persistent React DOM  errors requiring multiple refactorings (conditional rendering to , replacing Radix UI components with native HTML), authentication issues (, JWT validation), and MongoDB aggregation errors. The engineer systematically addressed these, enhancing backend models for addresses and orders, implementing a geocoding service, and revamping frontend UI for both customer and business panels to a Trendyol Go style. The most recent task involves a complete rebuild of the Business Panel.

<product_requirements>
The Kuryecini delivery platform supports Customer, Business, Courier, and Admin roles, prioritizing a modern UI, MongoDB persistence, and secure authentication.

**Implemented (Initial Phase 1 & 2A):** Courier PDF reports, profile updates, availability, order history filtering, real-time map, and initial customer panel UI with a Trendyol Go style (orange accent, dark mode, responsive grid, updated navigation, enhanced profile page).

**Refactored & Ongoing (User's New Detailed Plan - Chat Message 173):**
*   **Address Management:** CRUD for addresses with title, full address, city, district, neighborhood, postal code, phone, recipient name, and WGS84 coordinates. Map component with draggable pin, reverse geocoding (Leaflet + OpenStreetMap/Mapbox) with city-strict validation (no default to Istanbul, reject invalid geo results). Default address visible in Keşfet dropdown, linked to restaurant filtering.
*   **GPS & Location Accuracy:** Initial location permission, temporary location display, conversion to address. Strict city/district validation to prevent incorrect defaults.
*   **Discovery/Restaurants:** Smart sorting removed; simple sorting by distance, rating, delivery time. Restaurants listed based on selected address's  within a 70km radius (10km prioritized).
*   **Order Flow:** Product → Cart → Address Select → Payment Type (mock online/cash/POS) → Order. Status pipeline:  →  →  →  →  →  →  (or ). Real-time status updates via WebSocket/polling. Business panel must confirm  orders before next steps.
*   **Business Panel (New Refactor Focus):** Menu creation/editing, order management (filter by status), status update buttons, working region setup.
*   **General UI/UX:** Full Turkish text, accessibility, modern styling.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB.
-   **Authentication**: JWT, secure cookies, role-based access control.
-   **Data Persistence**: MongoDB with  indexing for geospatial queries, UUIDs instead of ObjectIDs.
-   **Mapping/Geocoding**: Leaflet, OpenStreetMap, Mapbox Places (for reverse geocoding).
-   **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket (with polling fallback).
-   **UI/Styling**: Tailwind CSS, CSS variables,  for DOM stability.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was tasked by the user to **İşletme panelini yeniden yap** (Rebuild the business panel). This instruction came after successfully fixing authentication and all  DOM errors, and confirming that the Customer Panel's GPS-based restaurant discovery and menu viewing (after a public menu endpoint was added) were functional, along with business menu CRUD.

The AI engineer has just initiated this rebuild, creating the foundational structure for the new business panel:
-   A new main entry component: .
-   A new dashboard component: .
-   A new menu management component:  (copied and adapted from the existing ).
-   Stubs for other sections:  and .

The next step in this current work is to integrate  into the main  to ensure the new business panel structure is rendered for business users.
