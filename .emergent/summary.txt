The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Kuryecini application development, focusing on critical real-time order management features. Initially, efforts were directed towards stabilizing frontend authentication, WebSocket connections, and addressing various UI/API bugs like double JSON parsing and infinite rendering loops. A significant milestone was the robust WebSocket implementation for multi-tab support and reconnection. The recent work focused heavily on integrating a business dashboard with real data, which involved creating new backend endpoints and extensive frontend modifications. This process unveiled and resolved several critical issues, including Pydantic model errors, router registration conflicts, incorrect API response handling in the frontend, and authorization flaws (403 errors, incorrect KYC status handling, and  vs uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) discrepancies in MongoDB queries). A complex order status transition flow (Pending -> Confirmed -> Preparing -> Ready) was implemented, later simplified to Pending -> Confirmed -> Ready. Concurrently, efforts were made to integrate courier map features, leading to the creation of new backend geo-location endpoints and frontend map components. The work is characterized by iterative bug fixing, addressing user feedback promptly, and adapting the implementation to evolving requirements. The last task involves resolving an issue where the courier map panel is not displaying correctly.

The Kuryecini platform is a multi-role (Customer, Business, Courier, Admin) application for real-time order management. Core features include order placement, business approval, courier task management, and real-time notifications. A key feature is the AI Diagnostics panel for Admin, with capabilities like log aggregation, PII redaction, RCA, and LLM-generated fixes, leveraging an Ops Co-Pilot for tool calling and context awareness. Recent requirements focused on stable WebSocket connections, a functional customer Order and Confirm flow, unique order codes, a defined order status transition (initially Pending -> Preparing -> Ready -> Confirmed, later simplified to Pending -> Confirmed -> Ready), automatic nearest courier assignment, printable order slips, and real-time data integration for the business dashboard. Latest requests expanded to include a simplified order flow (Hazırlanmaya Başla directly to Ready without package fee input), complete order details in the business panel, and a comprehensive courier map showing nearby businesses with available ready orders for claiming, with real-time WS updates.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user report that the Kurye harita paneli (Courier map panel) was not displaying or functioning correctly, despite previous work on its integration. This prior work included creating backend endpoints (, ) in  and modifying  to show business locations as pins with available order counts and allow couriers to claim orders. A runtime error () was previously fixed in . However, the user's latest message indicates that the map panel still has issues. The AI engineer has just started investigating this by reviewing  to understand how the map component is integrated and where the issue might lie, specifically to find the map tab or its rendering logic within the dashboard. The system has recently undergone extensive fixes for various issues across the business dashboard, menu management, customer menu display, order status transitions, and critical authentication/authorization flaws. The order processing flow has been simplified to transition directly from confirmed to ready.

Investigate  to identify why the courier map panel is not displaying correctly.
