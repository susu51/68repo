The previous AI engineer meticulously advanced the Kuryecini application, resolving numerous critical bugs and implementing substantial features. Initial efforts centered on fixing order display in the business panel due to  mismatches and frontend  issues, which were resolved via  and  modifications. Subsequent fixes included synchronizing the Menü Ürünleri: 0 count in the Business Dashboard, correcting Restoran bulunamadı on the DiscoverPage for GPS activation, and mitigating mobile keyboard closing issues in registration forms. A major architectural fix involved restructuring  to correctly render Admin Settings, which were previously unclickable due to incorrect  placement. Panel-based test buttons were added to Admin Settings. Authentication issues, an infinite refresh loop in the business panel, and WebSocket connectivity problems (missing , / protocol mismatch) were also addressed. Most recently, a comprehensive real-time order routing system, including database migrations, new order models, event publishing via WebSockets, and frontend integration with audible alerts, was implemented and fully tested.

The Kuryecini platform is a multi-role (Customer, Business, Courier, Admin) application, leveraging React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. Key functionalities include robust address management, geocoding, distance-based restaurant discovery, and real-time order processing. Recent feature development focused on a detailed, role-specific registration process with KYC, an advertisement system with city-filtered banners, and a modern, theme-aware login/registration UX. Menu management allows businesses to upload images. Restaurant discovery for customers is intelligent, using city/district and GPS filtering, and displays full addresses. An Admin Settings panel was required, including maintenance mode. A critical focus was ensuring the end-to-end order flow (add-to-cart, payment, order visibility) functions flawlessly across customer, business, and courier panels. The latest major requirement is to harden order routing with strict data models, indexing, API validations, real-time WebSocket updates, RBAC, improved notifications, comprehensive testing, and observability.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed a major hardening of the order routing system. This involved: running a database migration () to ensure all orders have correct  linkages and statuses, and to create necessary MongoDB indexes. New robust  models were defined in . The  endpoint in  was refactored for new models, comprehensive validations, item snapshots, and event publishing. A real-time WebSocket Pub/Sub system, including  and , was implemented in the backend. On the frontend,  was updated for the new API, and  was created and integrated into  for real-time updates, including a WebSocket connection indicator. Critical bugs were fixed: a backend 502 error ( not imported) and a WebSocket connection error ( vs  protocol mismatch). The last completed task was adding an audible alert () for new orders received via WebSocket, and the system has passed an end-to-end test with 100% success for order routing.
