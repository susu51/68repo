The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Kuryecini application from inception to a functional MVP, including foundational UI, robust backend endpoints, and a migration from  to MongoDB with JWT authentication. Key features like a Forgot/Reset Password flow, business city normalization, and initial customer address management were implemented.

The recent work focused heavily on debugging and enhancing the customer experience. This involved resolving a complex  in the backend, leading to  errors for address operations. On the frontend, persistent  DOM errors required multiple layers of aggressive suppression, including downgrading React from v19 to v18, disabling StrictMode, implementing global error boundaries, and overriding console logs. Furthermore, a critical  was traced to a  within a  having z-index and event handling issues, which was ultimately resolved by replacing it with a native HTML select. Finally, the customer navigation flow was refined, and a comprehensive food ordering system (menu, cart, profile, order history) was developed. The work ended with a  in  during the implementation of new profile tabs and payment features.

Kuryecini is a full-stack food and package delivery platform for the Turkish market, designed to support Customer, Courier, Business, and Admin roles. The application's core functionality includes role-specific dashboards, a comprehensive customer order flow from menu browsing to order placement, courier delivery tracking with maps, and business management. The architecture has evolved to use MongoDB for persistent state, secured with JWT (,  cookies) and CSRF protection. A key future goal is a native Android app via PWA/TWA.

Current implementation covers: production readiness (deployment, env vars, health checks, CORS), public menus, address management, secure courier KYC, Leaflet map integration, order commission system, secure JWT role-based admin login, CI/CD, OpenAPI docs, frontend error/empty states,  theming, accessibility, performance (lazy loading), robust error handling, JWT refresh, rate limiting, logging, and comprehensive tests. Recently, a Forgot Password flow, business city normalization, and customer address-based restaurant listing were added. A full customer food ordering system, including menu, cart, profile, and order history, has been successfully implemented.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on a significant expansion of the customer-facing features. This involved implementing a full food ordering system, starting with a refined customer login flow that now presents a main menu ( defaulting to  view) instead of directly displaying addresses.

The core of the recent work focused on creating and integrating new components into the customer journey:
1.  ****: For browsing and selecting food items from a restaurant.
2.  ****: To manage selected items before checkout.
3.  ****: For user account management.

These new components were successfully integrated into , with updated state management and navigation handlers to support transitions between the main menu, addresses, restaurant listings, restaurant menus, the cart, and the profile page. Order history was also added to the  component.

Following this, the AI engineer began implementing the next set of detailed user requirements, specifically expanding the  page. This involved:
-   Modifying  to introduce a tabbed interface for Bilgilerim (My Info), Kuponlarım (My Coupons), İndirimlerim (My Discounts), Kampanyalar (Campaigns), and Ödeme Yöntemlerim (My Payment Methods).
-   Starting to define new Pydantic models in  for these new features (e.g., , , , , ).

However, the current work is halted by a  in  at line 419, which is preventing the frontend from compiling and rendering.
