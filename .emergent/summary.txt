The AI engineer's work on the Kuryecini application began with a comprehensive Business Panel rebuild, addressing persistent React DOM errors with  and an enhanced error suppressor. Critical fixes included backend authentication for business endpoints, strict category validation, and rectifying  to parse JSON responses, which resolved silent data fetching failures. Subsequent efforts focused on resolving a  in  related to JSX Fragments, followed by implementing a user-provided, more robust  function with optimistic UI updates and improved error handling, extended to  and . A major refactor of the registration flow was undertaken, introducing a modern, wizard-style form with role-specific fields, city/district selection, and multi-part file uploads for KYC documents. Backend  and  endpoints were debugged and updated to support cookie-based authentication and file persistence. The Admin KYC panel was integrated to display pending requests and uploaded documents. The immediate focus is on enhancing the Admin KYC panel to show detailed contact information and documents.

The Kuryecini platform supports Customer, Business, Courier, and Admin roles, emphasizing a modern UI, MongoDB, and secure authentication. The current phase focuses on a refactor and expansion. Key features include CRUD for addresses with geocoding, distance-based restaurant discovery, and a real-time order flow ( to ). A completely rebuilt Business Panel includes menu management, order management, and region setup. The user also explicitly requested comprehensive E2E tests for the entire order flow, address switching, role guards, product CRUD, and real-time updates. Detailed role-specific registration forms (Customer, Courier, Business) with city/district/neighborhood selection and file uploads for KYC documents (license, vehicle, business photos) are required. The uploaded KYC documents and contact information must be viewable in the Admin KYC panel and on the user's own profile page.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical user request concerning the visibility of KYC documents and contact information in the Admin KYC panel. Previously, it was confirmed that file uploads via the  wizard successfully store documents in the backend, and the  endpoint returns KYC document metadata. A  component was created and integrated into  for user-side display. The admin  component could fetch pending requests, but the actual images and detailed contact information were not visually represented or fully detailed. The current task is to enhance  to properly display uploaded documents (likely as clickable links to the static files) and the comprehensive contact details of the user.
