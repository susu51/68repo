The AI engineer's work on the Kuryecini application progressed through several distinct phases. Initially, the focus was on core foundational elements: rebranding from DeliverTR to Kuryecini, implementing support for all 81 Turkish provinces, and integrating admin login into the standard flow. A significant portion of the work involved enhancing the admin panel for mobile responsiveness, incorporating a modern dark/light theme, and adding user management capabilities. A comprehensive customer-facing marketing theme was also introduced, featuring hero sections, social proof, and loyalty programs. Recurrent challenges included debugging persistent JSX and React runtime errors (), particularly in  and . More recently, the engineer successfully addressed critical issues such as the absence of food items on the customer side, implemented location-based and city-wide restaurant sorting, and resolved a specific  runtime error. Standardizing backend date serialization for MongoDB was also completed. The trajectory concludes with the user delivering a new, detailed and extensive set of product requirements, shifting the focus to future feature development.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to receiving the new comprehensive product requirements (Chat Message 276), the AI engineer was addressing several critical issues to enhance the Kuryecini application's stability and functionality. The primary focus was resolving the user-reported Hiçbir yemek müşteri kısmında gözükmüyor (No food visible on customer side) issue. This involved detailed inspection and modification within  and  to ensure that approved businesses and their respective food items were correctly fetched, processed, and displayed to customers.

Following this, the engineer implemented location-based (En Yakınım) and city-wide (Şehir Geneli) restaurant sorting functionality, as requested by the user, directly within , allowing customers to discover businesses based on proximity or across the entire city.

Concurrently, a persistent React runtime error, specifically a  error, was diagnosed and fixed. This error, often associated with unstable keys in list renderings or improper component unmounting, was observed during navigation between tabs in components like  and . The resolution involved refining  hooks,  checks, and ensuring correct  prop usage for dynamically rendered elements, thereby stabilizing the frontend.

Finally, the backend  and  were updated to standardize the JSON serialization of MongoDB s (converting them to strings) and  objects (converting to ISO format), preventing potential data transfer errors between the backend and frontend. The engineer had just concluded these bug fixes and stability improvements when the new, extensive list of product requirements was introduced.
