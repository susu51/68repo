The AI engineer's work on the Kuryecini application progressed through several distinct phases, moving from initial foundational enhancements to implementing a comprehensive set of new product requirements. Initially, the focus was on critical fixes such as  serialization and  React errors, along with core features like re-branding, admin login, and location-based sorting.

Following this, the engineer embarked on a major feature expansion, structured into phases. Phase 1 involved building a robust customer profile management system, integrating phone authentication, and updating branding. Phase 2 further expanded functionality with a modern login screen (including OAuth integration), an advertising carousel, enhanced location controls, categorized menu displays for businesses, and comprehensive courier/business/admin panels.

The development was iterative, involving file modifications across both frontend (, , new components) and backend (, ). Backend and frontend testing was conducted regularly. A notable challenge was a  duplicate declaration error in  and persistent frontend issues after several successful backend tests, which were eventually resolved. The trajectory concludes with the user reporting widespread errors after the AI engineer declared all systems functional, indicating a crucial pending debug task.
