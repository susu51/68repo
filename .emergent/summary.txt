The AI engineer's work primarily focused on extensive UI/UX enhancements and critical bug fixes for the Kuryecini application. Initial tasks involved fixing a missing  component, followed by a comprehensive login UI overhaul including gradient designs, OAuth/phone login placeholders, and dynamic register button behavior. A site-wide dark/light mode was implemented, with specific exclusions for the customer panel and landing page. Significant effort was dedicated to resolving routing issues, particularly ensuring the  page rendered correctly.

Debugging and feature additions also included enabling menu item image uploads for businesses, implementing smart restaurant filtering on the customer discover page based on city/district and GPS radius, and fixing issues with business KYC approval processes. The most recent challenges revolve around ensuring businesses register with correct GPS coordinates for discoverability and displaying full addresses in the customer panel, indicating a need for more robust location data handling. The engineer demonstrated iterative refinement based on user feedback, addressing issues from display glitches to core functionality.

<product_requirements>
The Kuryecini platform aims to provide a modern, role-based application for Customers, Businesses, Couriers, and Admins, leveraging React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. Key features include address management with geocoding, distance-based restaurant discovery, and real-time order processing. The Business Panel requires management of menus, orders, and regions.

Recent updates focus on:
-   **Detailed Registration:** Multi-step, role-specific forms with KYC document uploads.
-   **KYC Management:** Admin visibility of KYC documents and contact info, with approval processes for businesses.
-   **Advertisement System:** City-filtered, auto-sliding ad banners on the customer's Discover page, managed via an Admin panel.
-   **Login/Registration UX:** Modern login modal with email, phone, and OAuth options. Registration is a separate, dedicated page, with specific requests for visual styles and button placements (e.g., register in new tab, small buttons, specific gradient colors).
-   **Global Theme & UI:** Site-wide dark/light mode, explicitly excluding customer panels and the landing page from the dark theme.
-   **Menu Management:** Businesses should be able to upload images for menu items.
-   **Restaurant Discovery:** Customer panel should display businesses in the same city/district, with smart sorting (10km with GPS, 50km without).
-   **Address Display:** Full addresses should be visible in the customer discover section.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Authentication**: JWT, secure cookies, role-based access control (KYC approval for businesses).
-   **UI/Styling**: Tailwind CSS, CSS variables, React Context API for theme management.
-   **Routing**: React Router DOM (, , , ).
-   **State Management**: React , , , .
-   **File Uploads**: Backend  endpoint, frontend .
-   **Geocoding/Location**: Distance-based filtering for restaurants, city/district filtering.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical issues reported by the user regarding the customer experience and application functionality. The primary focus was on resolving why restaurants were not appearing in the customer panel, which was traced back to businesses potentially being registered without GPS coordinates. The AI had identified a need to integrate geocoding into the business registration process to capture these coordinates.

Simultaneously, the user reported that the Müşteri paneli kesfetteki adres açık adres olarak gözükmüyor (address in customer panel discover section is not showing full address). The AI acknowledged this and planned to investigate and fix this display issue, suggesting an underlying problem with how address details are fetched or presented in the . This indicates that the current work is centered around enhancing location data handling and display across the platform for accurate restaurant discovery and user experience.
