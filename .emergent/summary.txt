The AI engineer's work primarily involved a multi-phase development effort for the Kuryecini application. Initial work focused on stabilizing real-time order notifications, particularly for the Admin Panel. This involved extensive debugging of WebSocket connections, identifying and fixing a critical  dependency issue in the frontend hook () that caused immediate disconnections. Subsequently, the focus shifted to enhancing the order flow: ensuring business panels receive real-time notifications by adding event publishing to the backend  endpoint and correctly configuring the business-side WebSocket hook. A significant portion of the work addressed customer order placement issues, fixing incorrect API endpoints, request body formats, and then a series of cascading frontend syntax errors in  and . The final stage of the trajectory began with the user providing a comprehensive requirement for an AI Diagnostics panel, which the AI engineer has broken down into phases. The current work is on Phase 1 of this AI Diagnostics panel, involving backend models, ingestion endpoints, and a frontend UI shell.

The Kuryecini platform is a comprehensive multi-role (Customer, Business, Courier, Admin) application built using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. Key functionalities include address management, geocoding for restaurant discovery, role-specific registration with KYC, and advertisement display. Recent updates focused on a modern login/registration UX and menu management. A critical objective is a seamless, real-time end-to-end order flow across all user panels.

**Implemented so far:**
*   **Real-time Order Routing System**: Hardened with strict data models, indexing, API validations, WebSocket updates, RBAC, and improved notifications.
*   **Admin Panel Real-time Order Visibility**: Integrated real-time order updates into the Admin panel, displaying live orders with filters. Initial WebSocket connection issues were resolved.
*   **Business Panel Real-time Notifications**: Ensured new orders are pushed to the relevant business panel via WebSockets.
*   **Customer Order Placement**: Fixed issues preventing customers from placing orders, including API endpoint correctness, request body formatting, and basic UI flow. Order ID display post-order was added.
*   **Business Order Approval Flow**: Implemented a Confirm Order button in the Business Panel, allowing businesses to set a Paket Başına Fiyat (unit delivery fee) and confirm orders, which then creates a  and publishes an event to a global courier topic.
*   **Courier Waiting Tasks Panel**: Added a Bekleyen Paketler (Waiting Tasks) tab to the Courier Dashboard for future map integration.
*   **Backend Stability**: Executed MongoDB migrations for orders and restaurants, ensured correct  population.

**New Feature Request (AI Diagnostics Panel):**
A secure, multi-app AI Diagnostics panel for the Admin Panel that aggregates logs from all application sites (customer, business, courier, admin), performs PII redaction, classifies errors, conducts Root Cause Analysis (RCA), and proposes fixes with example code patches using ChatGPT. It requires backend data models (, , ), an ingestion API (), PII redaction logic, fingerprinting/clustering, and a React/Tailwind frontend UI with various tabs (Özet, Kümeler, Loglar, AI Yardımcı, Ayarlar). Strict RBAC and rate-limiting are required.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing a secure, multi-app AI Diagnostics panel within the Admin Panel. This is a large feature, and the user prioritized it into phases. The AI engineer is currently working on **Phase 1** of the AI Diagnostics system, which involves establishing the foundational backend and a placeholder frontend UI.

Specifically, the AI has:
1.  **Environment Setup**: Added , ,  to the backend's  file.
2.  **MongoDB Models**: Created  to define the data structures for  and .
3.  **Log Ingestion Endpoint**: Created  to handle incoming log entries from various applications, which will include PII redaction and error fingerprinting.
4.  **Frontend UI Shell**: Created  as a placeholder component for the Admin UI.
5.  **Integration**: The next immediate step is to integrate the newly created  router into the main FastAPI application ().

Before starting this new feature, the AI engineer successfully addressed several critical issues, including stabilizing WebSocket connections for admin and business panels, ensuring real-time order notifications were correctly routed, fixing the customer order placement flow (API calls, UI navigation, and cart handling), and correcting numerous frontend syntax errors introduced during development. The system now has functional real-time order updates for business and admin, and customer order placement is working (after many fixes).
